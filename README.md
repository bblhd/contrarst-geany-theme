# contrarst-geany-theme
A dark and a light three colour (excluding background and foreground) theme for geany based on percieved brightness and trial and error.

I don't use all of the features available in geany, nor do I write in every programming/markdown language. If anything seems like a mistake or an oversight, please tell me.
